TYPING TUTOR:
-
\>'Teacher' writes words (not finite) in a text file

\>Compiles it

\>Student gets the compiled executable

\>Types out words and can redo it as many times as they like

\>Results are generated based on the student's capabilities

\>Can be repeated with different, less, or more words by the teacher

\>Problem is, Student can edit the result's text file, as its unencrypted

\>Therefore, the requirements for the program to run, are:

\>A pure heart (because this has literally no security measure whatsoever lol)

\>Windows

\>Future objectives: Encrypt the final file?
